# Description

Building upon the caption generator model from [Machine Learning Mastery by Jason Brownlee](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-a-deep-learning-caption-generation-model-in-python/), this application will generate a short 100 word paragraph of an uploaded image, based off of the features in the image. This application uses the [FLICKR_8K](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398/) dataset, which is a dataset composed of around 8000 images with captions. 

The model being used initially for the caption generation is [Oxford Visual Geometry Group or VGG model, provided by Keras](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/).

The UI is to be built. 

There are so many interpretations we can give to a picture, lets see what AI wants to say.
